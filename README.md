# Smash 'Nalysis

Smash 'Nalysis is a peer-analysis website for video games that uses Youtube timestamps to offer a better context. Users post Youtube urls of their game clip they would like to be analyzed, then other users watch their game and analyze it. When a user is watching the video and comments, Smash 'Nalysis takes the current time of the video and maps a timestamp to the user's comment so when anyone is reading the comments they will know exactly what the original commenter was referring to. Smash 'Nalysis smooths the user experience by offering an intuitive UI that works exactly how it should, prioritizing context for analysis. Smash 'Nalysis also utilizes a user voting system to naturally determine better analyses.

Smash 'Nalysis used to be hosted at vods.jeremychinsen.me but I have taken it down recently. Here is a demo of the site: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3rRXKul4S4&feature=youtu.be
